## Report a security issue

The Question project welcomes security reports and is committed to providing prompt attention to security issues. Security issues should be reported privately via [d.j.goddeau@gmail.com](mailto:d.j.goddeau@gmail.com). Security issues should not be reported via the public Github Issue tracker.

## Vulnerability coordination

Remediation of security vulnerabilities is prioritized. The project team coordinates remediation with third-party project stakeholders via [Github Security Advisories](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories). Third-party stakeholders may include the reporter of the issue, affected direct or indirect users of Question, and maintainers of upstream dependencies if applicable.

## Security advisories

The project team is committed to transparency in the security issue disclosure process. We announce security issues via [project Github Release notes](https://github.com/sevro/question/CHANGELOG.md).

## Security Updates

Security updates will be published as non-breaking changes via semantic versioning.
